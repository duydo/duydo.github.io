      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve received many requests to build the Vietnamese Analysis plugin when a new version of Elasticsearch is released but sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m not available to do it immediately. In case of urgent, you can build it yourself with following steps.
Step 1: Install Java, Maven &amp;amp; Git The plugin is written in Java and built with Maven, so you have to install them first. Here is the instructions for installing Java, Maven and Git.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some months ago, I had an interview with &lt;a href=&#34;https://elastic.co&#34;&gt;Elastic&lt;/a&gt; for Java Software/Support Engineer position. The interview was an interesting experience I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had, Elastic is a brilliant company with great people and amazing culture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series covering the architecture of Elasticsearch based on my experience while working with it. In this post, we’ll be discussing how the cluster works, try to find answers for following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a node in cluster talks to others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when a node joins or leaves the cluster?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when a node stops or has encountered a problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

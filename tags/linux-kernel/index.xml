      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in mid-2019, while I was working on the Data Platform team at Krom, I ran into a problem that lingered long after it was fixed. Our Celery workers would occasionally stop processing tasks without any obvious signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervisor still showed them as &lt;code&gt;RUNNING&lt;/code&gt;, with uptimes measured in days, but zero tasks were processed. Data pipelines quietly stalled, alerts never fired, and the only clue was an occasional &lt;code&gt;Broken pipe&lt;/code&gt; buried in the logs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

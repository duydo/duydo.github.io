## About Me – Duy Đỗ

I grew up in Quảng Ngãi, where my love for logic and problem-solving began during high school math competitions. I won **provincial-level Math award**, then qualified for the **national Math team** – the **first student from Sơn Tịnh 1 High School** to achieve this. Though I didn’t win a national prize, that journey built a solid foundation that led me to **Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)**.

In my second year of university, I taught myself **Java** and built **JTranslator** – a simple, free desktop dictionary. To my surprise, it gained thousands of users, was featured in *E-Chips* magazine, attracted mobile porting offers, and even earned a collaboration request from a Thai university to develop a Vietnamese–Thai version. That was when I realized: *code can reach far beyond your own screen*.

Next came **PHP**: I created themes for vBB forums, took on freelance web projects (including e-commerce sites for mobile phones), and earned my **first income from programming**. After graduation, I started my career with **Java**, building large-scale online gaming systems – where I learned how to design reliable, high-concurrency platforms.

In 2010 at **BigLabs**, I worked on a lightweight Splunk alternative using **Hadoop** and **Elasticsearch** – and *fell in love with Elasticsearch*. I went from user to contributor: developed the widely-used **Vietnamese Analysis Plugin**, built **EVM** (a local version manager for Elasticsearch), and advised major companies like **Viettel, Tiki, and FPT Sendo**.

Thanks to my big data experience at BigLabs, **Sentifi** recruited me to build large-scale data collection and search systems using **Python** and **Elasticsearch**. This phase sharpened my skills in system architecture, performance, and real-world data pipelines.

In 2021, I co-founded **KromLab** with two friends – an R&D company focused on influencer marketing. I lead the **Data Platform**, from ingestion pipelines to search and behavioral analytics.

Despite running a startup and raising **three young children**, I continue contributing to the **Elasticsearch community**. In 2023, Elastic officially recognized me as an **Elastic Contributor** – a small but meaningful milestone.

**What I love**  
Distributed systems, search engines, cloud platforms (AWS & GCP), performance optimization, and… **algorithms** – still my joy from high school days. Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring new places with my family and believe that **curiosity, persistence, and sharing** are the best paths to growth.

If you're building search systems, optimizing data, or just want to chat about tech and life – feel free to reach out.

## Code & Systems

I live at the intersection of **Computer Science and Mathematics**.  
My sweet spot: **large-scale, high-performance systems**—distributed architectures, search engines, data pipelines, and machine learning that actually moves the needle.

- Built Elasticsearch clusters that serve **10 M+ queries/day** with sub-50 ms p99 latency  
- Optimized data ingestion pipelines to cut costs by **40 %** while scaling 5×  
- Obsessed with every millisecond and every byte

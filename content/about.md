I'm Duy Do, aka duydo. I live with my wife and two cute kids in Saigon, Vietnam. I'm interested in in search engine, data analytics, big data, distributed systems and building interesting tools.

Beside my daily works at our startup to build a new influencer marketing platform with [Xomad](http://xomad.com) team, I also work on open source softwares. I'm author of [Vietnamese Elasticsearch analysis plugin](https://github.com/duydo/elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese) and founder of the [Vietnamese Elasticsearch community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/elasticsearchvn/). I love coding. I live, breath and eat code everyday.

You can find me somewhere else on [Twitter @duydo](https://twitter.com/duydo), [GitHub](https://github.com/duydo), [LinkedIn](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/duydo) or the roads I run every morning.

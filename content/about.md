I'm Duy Do, a passionate software developer from Vietnam, now living in Ho Chi Minh city with my wife, son and daughter.

My areas of interest include distributed systems, search engine, data processing, data analytics, machine learning and performance optimizations.

Currently I work as a Software Engineer for Krom, a small tech company I'm a co-founder of. Besides the daily works, I have been running [Vietnamese Elasticsearch community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/elasticsearchvn/) and working on some open source projects in my spare time, such as: [Vietnamese Elasticsearch analysis plugin](https://github.com/duydo/elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese), [Elasticsearch Version Manager](https://github.com/duydo/evm)
  and [Python Client for Mapzen APIs](https://github.com/duydo/python-mapzen).

You can find me somewhere else on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duydo), [GitHub](https://github.com/duydo) and [LinkedIn](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/duydo).

I'm Duy Do, a passionate software developer from Vietnam, now living in Ho Chi Minh city with my wife, son and daughter. I'm interested in in search engine, data analytics, distributed systems and building interesting tools. 

Beside my daily works at our startup to build a new influencer marketing platform with [Xomad](http://xomad.com) team, I also work on open source softwares in my spare time. I'm author of [Vietnamese Elasticsearch analysis plugin](https://github.com/duydo/elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese) and creator of the [Vietnamese Elasticsearch community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/elasticsearchvn/). 

You can find me somewhere else on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duydo), [GitHub](https://github.com/duydo), [LinkedIn](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/duydo) or email me at doquocduy at gmail.com.

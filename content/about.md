## Code & Systems

I live at the intersection of **Computer Science and Mathematics**.  
My sweet spot: **large-scale, high-performance systems**—distributed architectures, search engines, data pipelines, and machine learning that actually moves the needle.

- Built Elasticsearch clusters that serve **10 M+ queries/day** with sub-50 ms p99 latency  
- Optimized data ingestion pipelines to cut costs by **40 %** while scaling 5×  
- Obsessed with every millisecond and every byte

I'm Duy Do. I live in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam with my two cute kids and a beautiful wife.

Currently, I am doing a small tech start-up as co-founder with my two friends. My areas of interest include information retrieval, distributed systems, data processing, data analytics, performance monitoring and development of new products interesting ways.

I love working with open source software. I have been contributing to Elasticsearch with
[Vietnamese analysis plugin](https://github.com/duydo/elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese) and founded [the Vietnamese Elasticsearch community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/elasticsearchvn/).

You can find me somewhere else on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duydo), [GitHub](https://github.com/duydo), [LinkedIn](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/duydo) or 
on roads where I run every morning.

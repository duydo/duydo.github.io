I gave a talk about [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org) when working at [Sentifi](http://sentifi.com).
<!--more-->

> Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.
The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more worker servers using multiprocessing, `Eventlet`, or `gevent`. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready).
Celery is used in production systems to process millions of tasks a day.
